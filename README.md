# Kanoodle-solver
**Using a DP table algorithm to solve a Kanoodle Puzzle**
Nope, nvm. We'll be practicing basic algorithms on a hard hard problem
There are 12 different floor tiles, all shaped into different forms that need to be pieced
together. The objective is to create a solver, or something that searches for a path where all 
tiles can fit into the grid. Either that or it's die trying


![Kanoodle 3d Set](https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Educational-Insights-Kanoodle-3-D-Brain-Teaser-Puzzle-Game-Easter-Basket-Toy-Featuring-200-Challenges-Ages-7_798d8834-38a6-4b63-877b-ff11629bc0dd.3db672ddcc36fe9d29f4d76230ec8c6c.jpeg?odnHeight=640&odnWidth=640&odnBg=FFFFFF)

Specifically, this set contains a pamphlet of puzzles that are solvable by
fitting all the pieces in the grid.

This is a subsequence problem, essentially searching for a pattern where all
pieces are placed together to fit perfectly

OK if anyone can help me minimize and improve my current backtracking garbage alg lmk thanks
